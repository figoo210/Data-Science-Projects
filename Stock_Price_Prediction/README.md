## Stock Price Prediction with ATR and ADX Indicators

### About

This project aims to predict stock prices using technical indicators such as the Average True Range (ATR) and Average Directional Index (ADX). These indicators are commonly used in technical analysis to assess the strength of a trend and volatility in the stock market.

### Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

### Usage

1. **Data Collection**: Obtain historical stock price data from a financial data provider or API.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Calculate technical indicators such as ATR and ADX from the raw stock price data.
3. **Model Training**: Train machine learning models on the historical data and technical indicators to predict future stock prices.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of each model using appropriate metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) or mean absolute error (MAE).
5. **Prediction**: Use the trained models to predict future stock prices based on current technical indicators.

### Folder Structure

- `stock_price_prediction.py`: Jupyter Notebook containing the data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.
- `data/`: Folder containing the historical stock price data.
- `results/`: Folder containing evaluation results and predicted stock prices.
