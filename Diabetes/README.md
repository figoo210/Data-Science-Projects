## Diabetes Prediction

### About

This project aims to predict the likelihood of an individual having diabetes based on various health metrics such as glucose level, blood pressure, BMI, etc. The dataset used for this analysis contains information about patients, including their health metrics and whether they have been diagnosed with diabetes.

### Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

### Usage

1. **Data Preprocessing**: The dataset undergoes preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, scaling features, and encoding categorical variables.
2. **Model Training**: Various machine learning algorithms are trained on the preprocessed data to build predictive models.
3. **Model Evaluation**: The performance of each model is evaluated using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
4. **Inference**: The trained model can be used to predict the likelihood of diabetes for new patients based on their health metrics.

### Folder Structure

- `diabetes_prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the entire analysis pipeline.
- `data/`: Folder containing the dataset used for analysis.
- `results/`: Folder containing evaluation results and model artifacts.
