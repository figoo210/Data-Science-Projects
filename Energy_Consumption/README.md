## Energy Consumption Analysis

### About

This project involves analyzing energy consumption patterns over time and identifying factors that influence energy usage. The dataset used for this analysis contains information about energy consumption, weather conditions, time of day, and other relevant factors.

### Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

### Usage

1. **Data Exploration**: Explore the dataset to understand the distribution of energy consumption and relationships with other variables.
2. **Visualization**: Create visualizations such as time series plots, histograms, and scatter plots to analyze energy consumption patterns and relationships with other factors.
3. **Statistical Analysis**: Conduct statistical analysis to identify correlations between energy consumption and various factors.
4. **Insights and Recommendations**: Derive insights from the analysis and provide recommendations for optimizing energy usage or improving efficiency.

### Folder Structure

- `energy_consumption.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the analysis and visualizations.
- `data/`: Folder containing the dataset used for analysis.
- `plots/`: Folder containing generated plots and visualizations.
