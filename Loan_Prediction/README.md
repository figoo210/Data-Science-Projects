## Loan Prediction

### About

This project focuses on predicting whether a loan applicant will default on their loan based on various features such as credit score, income, loan amount, etc. The dataset used for this analysis contains information about past loan applicants and whether they defaulted on their loans.

### Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

### Usage

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Prepare the dataset for modeling by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features.
2. **Model Training**: Train machine learning models on the preprocessed data to predict loan default.
3. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of each model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
4. **Deployment**: Deploy the trained model to predict loan default for new loan applicants.

### Folder Structure

- `loan_prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `data/`: Folder containing the dataset used for analysis.
- `models/`: Folder containing trained model artifacts.
